# Try Dependency Injection

Welcome to this GitHub repository dedicated to learning a simple dependency injection.
Here, you'll find a collection of Java classes demonstrating how you could create your own dependency injection.

Note that this is a very basic implementation just for demonstration purposes.
This implementation is still simplified and doesn't handle more advanced scenarios like circular dependencies or handling different scopes for dependencies.
It's important to keep in mind that building a robust and production-ready dependency injection framework requires a lot more consideration and features.
